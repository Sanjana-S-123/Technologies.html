   <p>HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the foundation of every webpage. It uses tags and elements to structure and display text, images, links, and other content within a web browser. While not a programming language itself, it's a core technology that's often combined with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. </p>
