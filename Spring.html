 <p>Spring Boot is an open-source, Java-based framework designed to simplify the development of standalone, production-grade Spring applications. It builds upon the Spring Framework, providing a streamlined and opinionated approach to configuration and setup, allowing developers to focus more on business logic rather than boilerplate code.</p>
